### About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Insightle is a platform for small business owners to receive unbiased feedback and for helpful customers to provide such feedback.
#### Features so far
1. Customers can leave anonymous feedback: A simple, user-friendly process for customers to provide their insights on the businesses they visit while remaining anonymous.

2. Business owners can view feedback: An intuitive interface that allows business owners to access and analyze feedback to gain valuable insights into their operations and customer experience.

3. Authentication: Secure login system for both business owners and customers, ensuring only verified users can participate in the platform.

### Motivation

Insightly started as an idea when we worked at a struggling restaurant. We were thinking it was really hard for small business owners to get unbiased feedback - they are usually extremely busy working with no days off, they can't ask their friends and family for unbiased opinions, and they get a very limited amount of internet reviews. So we wanted to build a platform for these owners to receive anonymous feedback from customers, fellow professionals, and overall anyone willing to help.
